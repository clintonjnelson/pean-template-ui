<h1>Privacy Notice</h1>

<br>
<p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for syynpost.com and www.syynpost.com. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>
  <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
  <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
  <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h3>
<p>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or allow us to obtain via permission. We will NOT sell or rent this information to ANYONE.</p>

<p>We hold the right to manage or remove any site or user information at any time, should we deem necessary, e.g. if a user is misusing the site or entering unsafe content</p>

<p>We will use your information to respond to you and to provide an improved product & experience. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to display your requested signs information.</p>

<p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email for confirmation of your registration, for when you request a password change, to provide updates on your syynpost's performance, to inform you of changes to this privacy notice, or to inform you of changes to our terms & conditions.</p>

<br>
<h3>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h3>
<p>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
  <li>Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
  <li>Have us delete any data we have about you.</li>
  <li>Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these features can be managed by directly on our website in your settings section and on your home page (where your signs are displayed for adding, editing, or removal).</p>


<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>

<p>Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page. We do not collect credit card information and will never request this from you on our website or via email.</p>

<p>We use 1-way hashing to encrypt your password. We have no way of retrieving and telling you your password. This is by design. If you forget your password or need to reset it, simply click the "forgot password" link in the signup/login area, and have a reset-password link sent to the email we have on record for you; once you receive the reset-password email, you can open it, and click the link inside to be redirected to our site where you can securely choose a new password.</p>

<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, to fix a problem in the site) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

<p>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy notice, you should contact us immediately via email at syynpost@gmail.com.</p>
