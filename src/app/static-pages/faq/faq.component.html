  <h3 id="whataresigns"> What are signs? </h3>
  <p>
    Signs are links to your online presences to help your fans find & follow you.

  <!--/ FAQ #3 -->
  <h3 id="whobuilds"> Does syynpost add sites without me knowing? </h3>
  <p>
    Nope. You hold complete control to your marketing and your privacy. You add the signs that point to the sites you want to be found on. If you don't add it, neither do we.

  <!--/ FAQ #4 -->
  <h3 id="usernamechange"> Can I change my syynpost link?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, you can. Your syynpost link is based on your syynpost username. You can change this in your settings page. If you change your username at any point, remember that any OLD LINKS with your former username will CEASE TO FUNCTION! You will need to UPDATE ALL OF YOUR OLD LINKS to your new syynpost link address. Otherwise, people may be trying to find you with the old links that no longer work. If anyone bookmarked the old link, that won't work either. Keep this in mind before you decide to change your username.

<!--/ FAQ #5 -->
  <h3 id="loginoptions"> What are the icons for when I click on "Login/Sign Up"?</h3>
  <p>
    The icons shown are the different websites you can use to login with. You've probably seen other websites & apps that say "Login with Facebook" or "Login with Twitter". It's the same concept, but there are more options. When you click to login for the first time, we will create a new account for you. Once you have an account and add signs with these "connected" websites, you can login with those icons as well!
  </p>

<!--/ FAQ #6 -->
  <h3 id="loginemptypost"> I have an existing account and logged in with a new icon, but don't see my other signs. Why?</h3>
  <p>
    If you don't already have a "connected" sign for that website in your account at the time you try to login, syynpost doesn't know it's you. Thus, it simply assumes you're a new person making a new account. No worries, extra accounts aren't a problem. Simply log out of the new account, then login again using a sign you already have. Once you're logged into the account you expected, you can click the "+" icon to add the new sign you wanted to your account. Once the new sign is added, you will be able to login with that icon as well.

  <!--/ FAQ #7 -->
  <h3 id="newsignoptions"> When I click "+" to add a sign, why are there two groups of icons?</h3>
  <p>
    The UPPER group of icons are what we call "AUTO signs" - websites syynpost can connect to directly to create a sign with minimal effort (usually just giving the "ok" when they ask you to verify you made the request).
  </p>
  <p>
    The LOWER group of icons are signs where you have to input the information yourself - the title you want to show, the website you want it to point (link) to, etc. Some of the information is not required, so fill out the optional pieces only if you prefer.
